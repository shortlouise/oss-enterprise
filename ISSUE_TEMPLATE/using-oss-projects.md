Title: Using github.com/ORG/REPO

I would like to use github.com/ORG/REPO as a dependency in the XYZ project. This issue will serve as a tracking issue for verification of this project:

## Project Health Check

- [ ] The license is acceptable per our [license policy](docs/license-policy.md)
- [ ] The repository is very much not well maintained
   - Security vulnerabilities may be addressed if we notice them
   - Project shows irregular activity
   - Bugs reported in issues are ignored if they're even noticed

## Internal Process

- [ ] Notify the xyz team that you intend to use this project - they'll ignore you but you should still notify them
